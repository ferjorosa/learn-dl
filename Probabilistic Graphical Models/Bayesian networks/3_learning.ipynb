    "Score-based methods approach the learning process from a model selection perspective. These methods define a hypothesis space of potential models, a set of operators to navigate this space, and a scoring function that measures how well the model fits the data. Then, the learning task is to find the highest-scoring BN structure. While this problem has proven to be NP-hard ([Chickering, 1996](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/1995/01/Learning-Bayesian-Networks-Search-Methods-and-Experimental-Results.pdf); [Chickering et al., 2004](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/chickering04a/chickering04a.pdf)), various techniques have been developed to render the structure search tractable. Depending on the nature of their search space, they are usually divided into two main groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Space of orders**. These algorithms assume an initial topological order for the variables, and use this prior ordering to reduce the complexity of the search space. Given a BN with $m$ nodes (where there is a maximum number of $k$ parents per node) and an ordering of the BN nodes, the highest-scoring BN structure can be learned in $O(m^{k})$ time [(Cooper, 1992](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00994110.pdf)). The main disadvantage of order-based search is that, without restrictions, the complexity of finding the true ordering is $O(m!)$. Despite this discouraging result, several algorithms have successfully approached this problem using both greedy search ([Teyssier and Koller, 2005](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.1429); [Scanagatta et al., 2017](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v73/scanagatta17a/scanagatta17a.pdf)} and metaheuristics ([Larrañaga et al., 1996](https://proceedings.mlr.press/r0/larranaga95a/larranaga95a.pdf); [Hsu et al., 2002](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Haipeng-Guo-6/publication/220741799_A_Permutation_Genetic_Algorithm_For_Variable_Ordering_In_Learning_Bayesian_Networks_From_Data/links/53fc0bef0cf22f21c2f3a1e3/A-Permutation-Genetic-Algorithm-For-Variable-Ordering-In-Learning-Bayesian-Networks-From-Data.pdf); [Faulker, 2007](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/4221263/4221264/04221271.pdf?casa_token=DB43BIzQbG4AAAAA:syRmQO5blv9_zMHf6JYQ2yI0VROUXJbOtoKndv69vUeRLZngegycqU9O6VGZcm_JdumUh6UgAQ))\n",
    "\t\n",
    "* **Space of structures**. These algorithms start with some initial structure $\\mathcal{G}_{0}$, usually an empty graph, which automatically becomes the currently best structure $\\mathcal{G}$. Then, they get all the neighbor structures of $\\mathcal{G}$ by applying local structure modification operators such as arc introduction (AI), arc elimination (AE), and arc reversal (AR). Certain arc restrictions $\\mathcal{R}_{A}$ may limit the structures produced by these operators. Finally, $\\mathcal{G}$ is replaced with the highest-scoring structure. This process is repeated until there are no changes in the structure that can improve the score. One of the initial works of this approach is the  hill-climbing (HC) method proposed by [Heckerman et al. (1995)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00994016.pdf), which is depicted in Algorithm (2.1). Several researchers have presented variants of this work that seek to make the search process faster and more accurate.

    "Constraint-based methods approach the learning process from a statistical independence point of view. These methods perform conditional independence tests and select the equivalence class of BNs that best explains them. An equivalence class of BNs is defined by all the BN structures that represent the same JPD.  Some of the key algorithms of the constraint-based approach are: inductive-causation ([Verma and Pearl, 1990](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3501714.3501732?casa_token=TRqD8YS8Cy4AAAAA:hBFRHCVc0F8eCk7Vkz_saoJsINFT07waKZ1CKWhMWJ5CohTjJWfeB4aZ_HPRVYKq9_3l9b82Zj2Z)), PC ([Spirtes et al., 2000](https://philarchive.org/archive/SPICPA-2)), grow-shrink ([Margaritis, 2003](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dmarg/Papers/PhD-Thesis-Margaritis.pdf)), and incremental association Markov blanket ([Tsamardinos et al., 2003](https://cdn.aaai.org/FLAIRS/2003/Flairs03-073.pdf)).\n",

    "All constraint-based methods share a common two-phase structure inherited from the inductive-causation algorithm. First, they learn the skeleton of the DAG by checking through conditional independence tests if there is a set of variables that separates a particular pair of variables. If that set is empty, then there must be an arc. Second, they try to assign directions to the arcs as in [Meek (1995)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.4972). The common limitation of these methods is their sensitiveness to failures in the conditional independence tests. A single mistake in one of these tests suffices to mislead the learning process. Another drawback is the amount of data required by these algorithms. The size of the data hugely increases with respect to the number of conditional variables in the independence test. "

Thus, all approximate inference methods we introduced in `2_inference.ipynb` can potentially be used for performing Bayesian estimation with incomplete data.

However, estimates obtained from this approach may be biased if the excluded instances are systematically different from those included.

    "[Friedman (1997)](http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~nirf/Papers/Fr1.pdf) proposes a completely different approach by generalizing the EM algorithm to the problem of score-based structure learning. This method, called SEM, is described in Algorithm (2.2). Similar to EM, it also iterates over a pair of steps. At each iteration $t$, in the expectation step, it uses the current model to generate a complete dataset $D^{*}_{t}$. Then, in the maximization step, it estimates not only the parameters of the new model, but also its structure. Any of the score-based procedures we described in Section 1.2.1 can be used for this purpose. However, the scoring function to be maximized must be a penalized version of the LL, as in Equation (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note the benefits of SEM compared to a brute-force approach: rather than re-estimating the model parameters after each structure change, the output of a single expectation step is used to perform many structure changes. At each iteration $t$, SEM selects the model $\\mathcal{B}_{t+1}$ with the highest expected score. The expected score is usually referred to as $\\text{score}(\\mathcal{D}^{*}_{t}, \\mathcal{B}_{t+1})$, and its use is motivated by the following inequality:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equation (8) states that an improvement in the observed score (i.e., using the observed data $\\mathcal{D}$) of network $\\mathcal{B}_{t+1}$, relative to the network $\\mathcal{B}_{t}$ that was used to generate $ \\mathcal{D}^{*}_{t}$, is at least as large as the improvement of the expected score using the completed data $\\mathcal{D}^{*}_{t}$. This guarantees that SEM converges  without the need of using probabilistic inference in each structure change. However, despite the computational savings provided by SEM, it is still a highly demanding algorithm due to the need of applying probabilistic inference in its expectation step. For this reason, works like [Scanagatta et al. (2018)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X17307272) and [Benjumeda et al.

When a latent variable is known to exist, we can introduce it into the BN model and apply methods such as the SEM algorithm to perform structure learning with incomplete data. However, we cannot simply place a latent variable arbitrarily in the model and expect our learning procedure to produce a reasonable model. In fact, if a latent variable is placed where it does not improve the model score, there is a good chance it will end up being disconnected from the rest of variables ([Koller and Friedman, 2009](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262013192/probabilistic-graphical-models/)).

As a result, [Elidan and Friedman (2005)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume6/elidan05a/elidan05a.pdf) propose instead to consider information signatures, which are identified using the information bottleneck method ([Tishby et al., 1999](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0004057); [Friedman et al., 2001](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.2270)). A completely different approach is to use a search method to iteratively explore a space of models. This idea was first proposed by [Zhang (2004)](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume5/zhang04a/zhang04a.pdf), which considered the space of latent tree models. Since then, it has been greatly improved with several methods and different strategies. For more information, see [Rodriguez-Sanchez et al. (2020)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel7/6287639/6514899/09207730.pdf) and [Rodriguez-Sanchez et al. (2021)](https://oa.upm.es/72625/3/LARRANAGA_2022_12_B.pdf) .\n"
