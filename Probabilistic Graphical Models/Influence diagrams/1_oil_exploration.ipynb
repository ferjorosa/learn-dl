    "An oil company is considering purchasing the <span style=\"color: red\"><b>option</b></span> (<span style=\"color: red\"><b>P</b></span>) an oil field. The oil field can have three quality levels (<span style=\"color: purple\"><b>Q</b></span>): high ($q_1$), medium ($q_2$), and low ($q_3$). The company obviously does not know the \"real\" qaulity of the field beforehand, but it can provide an estimation (i.e., <span style=\"color: purple\"><b>uncertainty</b></span> ) using historical data and imagery. **It is willing to pay a higher price for the field as its quality increases**.\n",

    "Before making the purchase decision, the company has the <span style=\"color: red\"><b>option</b></span> (<span style=\"color: red\"><b>T</b></span>) to perform a geological test. This test will have a certain cost and its results (<span style=\"color: purple\"><b>R</b></span>) will not be exact predictions about the quality of the field, but will provide a report on the porosity of the reservoir (high porosity generally indicates greater oil potential). The test will not be infallible, and thus contain a certain degree of <span style=\"color: purple\"><b>uncertainty</b></span>. The test can have two possible outcomes:\n",

    "* **Pass ($r_1$):** The porosity of the reservoir rock is equal to or greater than 15%, indicating significant oil potential.\n",

It will depend on its specific a priori beliefs about the quality of the land (for example, based on its historical data on oil fields with similar characteristics) and on the intrinsic uncertainty of the test (for example, the test may give a positive result but the field is not actually suitable, or vice versa).\n",
