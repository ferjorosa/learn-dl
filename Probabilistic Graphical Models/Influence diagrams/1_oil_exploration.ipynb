    "# Oil Field Decision Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook delves into the decision-making process for an oil company evaluating the purchase of an oil field. We will leverage two powerful frameworks: decision trees and influence diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Trees:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will begin by constructing a decision tree to analyze potential outcomes and guide the company towards the most profitable choice.\n",
    "* Through the decision tree, we will assess factors like oil field quality, geological test results, and potential uncertainties.\n",
    "* By assigning monetary values (utilities) to each scenario, we will quantify potential profits and estimate probabilities of various outcomes.\n",
    "* Ultimately, we will use these calculations to identify the decision sequence that maximizes the expected profit for the oil company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Influence Diagrams with [PyAgrum](https://pyagrum.readthedocs.io/en/0.16.1/):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, we will explore how to model the same problem using an influence diagram with the PyAgrum package.\n",
    "    * Influence diagrams offer a more visually intuitive representation of decision problems, explicitly depicting relationships between variables.\n",
    "* By comparing the decision tree and influence diagram approaches, we will gain a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations for this specific problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Future Developments: Integrating Large Language Models (LangChain):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a potential future development, we will briefly discuss how Large Language Models (LLMs) could be integrated into the decision process using LangChain.\n",
    "    * LLMs have the potential to automate tasks like data analysis and information retrieval, potentially enhancing the efficiency of the decision-making process."

It will depend on its specific a priori beliefs about the quality of the land (for example, based on its historical data on oil fields with similar characteristics), the intrinsic uncertainty of the test (for example, the test may give a positive result but the field is not actually suitable, or vice versa) and how the company values the possible consequences."
