    "Transformer models like DistilBERT cannot receive raw strings as input; instead, they assume the text has been *tokenized* and *encoded* as numerical vectors. Tokenization is the step of breaking down a string into the atomic units used in the model. There are several tokenization strategies one can adopt, and the optimal splitting of words into subunits is usually learned from the corpus. Before looking at the tokenizer used for DistilBERT, let's consider two extreme cases: *character* and *word* tokenization.\n",
