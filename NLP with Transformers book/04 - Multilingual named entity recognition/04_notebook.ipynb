    "# 4 - Multilingual named entity recognition\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this book we have applied transformers to solve NLP tasks on English corpora - but what do you do when your documents are written in Greek, Swahili, or Klingon? One approach is to search the Hugging Face Hub for a suitable pretrained language model and fine-tune it on the task at hand. However, these pretrained models tend to exist only for \"high-resource\" languages like German, Russian, or Mandarin, where plenty of webtext is available for pretraining. Another common challenge arises when your corpus is multilingual: maintaining multiple monolingual models in production will not be any fun for you or your engineering team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual transformers that come to the resue. Like BERT, these models use masked language moeling as a pretraining objective, but they are trained jointly on texts in over one hundred languages. By pretraining on huge corpora across many languages, these multilingual transformers enable **zero-shot cross-lingual transfer**.This means that a model that is fine-tuned on one language can be applied to others without any further training! This also makes these models well suited for \"code-switching\", where a speaker  alternates between two or more languages or dialects in the context of a single conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will focus on the encoder-only model XLM-RoBERTa ([Conneau et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116)), which can be fine-tuned to perform named entity recognition (NER) across several languages. NER is a common NLP task that identifies entities like people, organizations, or locations in text. These entities can be used for various applications such as gaining insights from company documents, augmenting the quality of search engines, or simply building a structured database from a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter, let's assume that we want to perform NER for a customer based in Switzerland, where there are four national languages (with English often serving as a bridge between them). Let's start by getting a suitable multilingual corpus for this problem."

    "## 4.1 - The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a subset of the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark called WikiANN or PAN-X. This dataset consists of Wikipedia articles in many languages, including the four most commonly spoken languages in Switzerland: German (62.9%), French (22.9%), Italian (8.4%), and English (5.9%). Each article is annotated with <code>LOC</code> (location), <code>PER</code> (person), and <code>ORG</code> (organization) tags in the [\"inside-outside-beginning (IOB2) format\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the IOB2 format, a <code>B-</code> prefix indicates the beginning of an entity, and consecutive tokens belonging to the same entity are given an <code>I-</code> prefix. An <code>O</code> tag indicates that the token does not belong to any entity. For example, the following sentence:\n",
