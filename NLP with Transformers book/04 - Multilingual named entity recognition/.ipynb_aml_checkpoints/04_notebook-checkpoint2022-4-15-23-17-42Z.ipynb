    "# 4 - MULTILINGUAL ENTITY RECOGNITION\n",
    "\n",
    "So far in this book we have applied transformers to solve NLP tasks on English corpora - but what do you do when your documents are written in Greek, Swahili, or Klingon? One approach is to search the Hugging Face Hub for a suitable pretrained language model and fine-tune it on the task at hand. However, these pretrained models tend to exist only for \"high-resource\" languages like German, Russian, or Mandarin, where plenty of webtext is available for pretraining. Another common challenge arises when your corpus is multilingual: maintaining multiple monolingual models in production will not be any fun for you or your engineering team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual transformers that come to the resue. Like **BERT**, these models use masked language moeling as a pretraining objective, but they are trained jointly on texts in over one hundred languages. By pretraining on huge corpora across many languages, these multilingual transformers enable **zero-shot cross-lingual transfer**.This means that a model that is fine-tuned on one language can be applied to others without any further training! This also makes these models well suited for \"code-switching\", where a speaker  alternates between two or more languages or dialects in the context of a single conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will focus on the encoder-only model **XLM-RoBERTa** ([Conneau et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116)), which can be fine-tuned to perform named entity recognition (NER) across several languages. NER is a common NLP task that identifies entities like people, organizations, or locations in text. These entities can be used for various applications such as gaining insights from company documents, augmenting the quality of search engines, or simply building a structured database from a corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this chapter, let's assume that we want to perform NER for a customer based in Switzerland, where there are four national languages (with English often serving as a bridge between them). Let's start by getting a suitable multilingual corpus for this problem."

    "## 4.1 - The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a subset of the Cross-lingual TRansfer Evaluation of Multilingual Encoders (XTREME) benchmark called WikiANN or PAN-X. This dataset consists of Wikipedia articles in many languages, including the four most commonly spoken languages in Switzerland: German (62.9%), French (22.9%), Italian (8.4%), and English (5.9%). Each article is annotated with <code>LOC</code> (location), <code>PER</code> (person), and <code>ORG</code> (organization) tags in the [\"inside-outside-beginning (IOB2) format\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the IOB2 format, a <code>B-</code> prefix indicates the beginning of an entity, and consecutive tokens belonging to the same entity are given an <code>I-</code> prefix. An <code>O</code> tag indicates that the token does not belong to any entity. For example, the following sentence:\n",

    "\n",
    "Multilingual transformers involve similar architectures and training procedures as their monolingual counterparts, except that the corpus used for pretraining consists of documents in many languages. <span style=\"color:blue\">A remarkable feature of this approach is that despite receiving no explicit information to differentitate among the languages, the resulting linguistic representations are able to generalize well across languages for a variety of downstream tasks</span>. In some cases, this ability to perform cross-lingual transfer can produce results that are competitive with those of monolingual models, which circumvents the need to train one model per language!\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the progress of cross-lingual transfer for NER, the [CoNLL-2002](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2002) and [CoNLL-2003](https://huggingface.co/datasets/conll2003) datasets are often used as benchmark for English, Dutch, Spanish, and German. This benchmark consists of news articles annotated with the same `LOC`, `PER` and `ORG` categories as PAN-X, but it contains an additional `MISC` label for miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multilingual transformer models are usually evaluated in three different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `en`. Fine-tune on the English training data and then evaluate on each language's test set.\n",
    "* `each`. Fine-tune and evaluate on monolingual test data to measure per-language performance.\n",
    "* `all`. Fine-tune on all the training data to evaluate on each language's test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will adopt similar evaluation strategy for our NER task, but first we need to select a model to evaluate. One of the first multilingual transformers was **mBERT**, which uses the same architecture and pretraining objective as **BERT** but adds Wikipedia articles from many languages to the pretraining corpus. Since then, **mBERT** has been superseded by **XLM-RoBERTa**, or **XLM-R** for short, so that is the model we'll consider in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "XLM-R uses only masked language modeling as its pretraining objective for 100 languages, but it is distinguished by the huge size of its pretraining corpus compared to its predecessors: Wikipedia dumps for each language and 2.5 terabytes of Common Crawl data from the web. This corpus is several orders of magnitude larger than the ones used in earlier models and provides a significant boost in signal for low-resource languages like Burmese and Swahili, where only a small number of Wikipedia articles exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RoBERTa part of the model's name refers to the fact that the pretrainig approach is the same as for the monolingual RoBERTa models. RoBERTa's developers improved on several aspects of BERT, in particular by removing the next sentence prediction task altogether. XLM-R also drops the language embeddings used in XLM and **uses SentencePiece** ([Kudo and Richardson, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06226)) **to tokenize the raw texts directly**. <span style=\"color:blue\">Besides its multilingual nature, a notable difference between XLM-R and RoBERTa is the size of the respective vocabularies: 250,000 tokens versus 55,000!</span>"

    "\n",
    "### 4.3.1 - The tokenizer pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have treated tokenization as a single operation that transforms strings to integers we can pass through the model. This is not entirely accurate, and if we take a closer look we can see that it is actually a full processing pipeline that usually consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tokenizer_pipeline.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" data-align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at each step of the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">This step corresponds to the set of operations you apply to a raw string to make it more \"cleaner\"</span>. Common operations include stripping whitespace and removing accented characters. Unicode normalization is another common normalization operation applied by many tokenizers to deal with the fact that there often exist various ways to write the same character. This can make two versions of the “same” string (i.e., with the same sequence of abstract characters) appear different; Unicode normalization schemes like NFC, NFD, NFKC, and NFKD replace the various ways to write the same character with standard forms. Another example of normalization is lowercasing. If the model is expected to only accept and use lowercase characters, this technique can be used to reduce the size of the vocabulary it requires. After normalization, our example string would look like: `jack sparrow loves new york!`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pretokenization**\n",
    "\n",
    "This step splits a text into smaller objects that give an upper bound to what your tokens will be at the end of training. A good way to think of this is that the pretokenizer will split your text into \"words\" and your final tokens will be parts of those words. For the languages that allow this (English, German, and many Indo-European languages), strings can typically be split into words on whitespace and punctuation. For example, this step might transform our `[\"jack\", \"sparrow\", \"loves\", \"new\", \"york\", \"!\"]`. These words are  then simpler to split into subwords with Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or Unigram algorithms in the next step\n",
    "of the pipeline. <span style=\"color:blue\">However, splitting into \"words\" is not always a trivial and deterministic operation, or even an operation that makes sense. For instance, in languages like Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, grouping symbols in semantic units like Indo-European words can be a nondeterministic operation with several equally valid groups. <b>In this case, it might be best to not pretokenize the text and instead use a language-specific library for pretokenization</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tokenizer model**\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once the input texts are normalized and pretokenized, the tokenizer applies a subword splitting model on the words. <span style=\"color:blue\">This is the part of the pipeline that needs to be trained on your corpus (or that has been trained if you are using a pretrained tokenizer). <b>The role of the tokenizer is to split the words into subwords to reduce the size of the vocabulary and try to reduce the number of out-of-vocabulary tokens</span>. Several subword tokenization algorithms exist, including BPE, Unigram, and WordPiece. For instance, our running example might look like [jack, spa, rrow, loves, new, york, !] after the tokenizer model is applied. Note that at this point we no longer have a list of strings but a list of integers (input IDs); to keep the example illustrative, we’ve kept the words but dropped the quotes to indicate the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Post-processing**\n",
    "    \n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">This is the last step of the tokenization pipeline, in which some additional transformations can be applied on the list of tokens. For instance, by adding special tokens at the beginning or end of the input sequence of token indices</span>. For example, a BERT-style tokenizer would add classifications and separator tokens: `[CLS, jack, spa, rrow, loves, new, york, !, SEP]`. This sequence (recall that this will be a sequence of integers, not the tokens you see here) can then be fed to the model."

This last feature is especially useful for multilingual corpora since it allows SentencePiece to be agnostic about accents, punctuation, and the fact that many languages, like Japanese, do not have whitespace characters. Another special feature of SentencePiece is that whitespace is assigned the Unicode symbol `U+2581`, or the `▁` character, also called the lower one quarter block character. This enables SentencePiece to detokenize a sequence without ambiguities and without relying on language-specific pretokenizers. \n",

We can later easily propagate the predicted label of the first subword to the subsequent subwords in the postprocessing step.

    "Evaluating a NER model is similar to evaluating a text classification model, and it is common to report results for precision, recall, and F1-score. The only subtlety is that <span style=\"color:blue\">all words of an entity need to be predicted correctly in order for a prediction to be counted as correct</span>. Fortunately, there is a nifty library called [seqeval](https://github.com/chakki-works/seqeval) that is designed for these kinds of tasks. For example, given some placeholder NER tags and model predictions, we can compute the metrics via seqeval’s `classification_report()` function:"
