    "The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science. Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved. Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow. Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez. Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them—they were so close they could touch their horns. While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English …\n",

    "## 5.1 - The challenge with generating coherent text\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we have focused on tackling NLP tasks via a combination of pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. As we have seen, for task-specific heads like sequence or token classification, generating predictions is fairly straightforward; the model produces some logits and we take the maximum value to get the predicted class. By contrast, converting the model's probabilistic output to text requires a **decoding method**, which introduces a few challenges that are unique to text generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The decoding is done **iteratively** and thus involves significantly more compute than simply passing inputs once through the forwards pass of a model.\n",
    "* The **quality** and **diversity** of the generated text depend on the choice of decoding method and associated hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how this decoding process works, let's start by examining how GPT-2 is pretrained and subsequently applied to generate text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other autoregressive or causal language models, GPT-2 is pretrained to estimate the probability $P(y|x)$ of a sequence of tokens $\\mathbf{y} = y_{1}, \\dots, y_{t}$, ocurring in the text, given some initial prompt or context sequence $\\mathbf{x} = x_{1}, \\dots, x_{k}$. Since it is impractical to adcquire enough training data to estimate $P(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$ directly, it is common to use the chain rule of probability to factorize it as a product of conditional probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y_{1}, \\dots, y_{t}| \\mathbf{x}) = \\prod_{t=1}^{N} P(y_{t}|y_{1}, \\dots, y_{t-1}, \\mathbf{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is from these conditional probabilities that we pick up the intuition that autoregressive language modeling amounts to predicting each word given the preceding words in a sentence; this is exactly what the probability on the righthand side of the preceding equation describes. <span style=\"color:blue\">Notice that this pretraining objective is quite different from BERT's, which utilizes both <b>past</b> and <b>future</b> contexts to predict a *masked* token.</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/text_generation_example.png\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" data-align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown by the figure, we start with a prompt like \"Transformers are the\" and use the model to predict the next token. Once we have determined the next token, we append it to the prompt and then use the new input sequence to generate another token. We do this until we have reached a special end-of-sequence token or a predefined maximum length.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Since the output sequence is *conditioned* on the choice of input prompt, this type of text generation is often called <span style=\"color:blue\">conditional text generation</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of this process lies a decoding method that determines which token is selected at each timestep. Since the language model head produces a <span style=\"color:blue\">logit</span> $z_{t,i}$ per token in the vocabulary at each step, we can get the probability distribution over the next possible token $w_{i}$ by taking the softmax:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(y_{t} = w_{i} | y_{1}, \\dots, y_{t-1}, \\mathbf{x}) = \\text{softmax}(z_{t,i})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of most decoding methods is to search for the most likely overall sequence by picking a $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\underset{\\mathbf{y}}{argmax} \\ P(\\mathbf{y} | \\mathbf{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:blue\">Finding</span> $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ <span style=\"color:blue\">directly would involve <b>evaluating every possible sequence</b> with the language model. Since there does not exist an algorithm that can do this in a reasonable amount of time, <b>we rely on approximations instead</b></span>."

    "Instead of decoding the token with the highest probability at each step, beam search keeps track of the top-$b$ most probable next tokens, where $b$ is referred to as the number of *beams* or partial hypotheses. The next set of beams are chosen by considering all possible next-token extensions of the existing set and selecting the $b$ most likely extensions. The process is repeated until we reach the maximum length or an EOS token, and the most likely sequence is selected by ranking the $b$ beams according to their log probabilities. We use the logarithm of the probability because the computer would not be able to precisly represent (i.e., numerical instability) the result of multipliying many small numbers (i.e., probabilities). Instead we estimate their sum of log probabilities, which is much less likely to run into numerical instabilities.\n",

In the lower plot, we have ordered the tokens by descending probability and calculated the cumulative sum of the first 10000 tokens (in total, there are 50257 tokens in GPT-2's vocabulary). The curved line indicates the probability of picking any of the preceding tokens. For example, there is roughly a 96% chance of picking any of the 1000 tokens with the highest probability. \n",

Although these numbers might appear small at first sight, they become important because we sample once per token when generating text. So, even if there is a small probability, if we sample hundreds of times there is a significant chance of picking an unlikely token at some point, which in some cases can badly influence the quality of the generated text. For this reason, we generally want to avoid these very unlikely tokens. This is where top-$k$ and top-$p$ sampling come into play."
