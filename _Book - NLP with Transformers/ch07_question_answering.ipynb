    "# 7 - Question answering\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many flavours of question answering (QA), but the most common is extractive QA, which involves questions whose answer can be identified as a psan of text in a document, where the document might be a web page, legal contract, or news article. The two-stage process of first retrieving relevant documents and then extracting answers from them is also the basis for many modern QA systems, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* semantic search engines\n",
    "* intelligent assistants\n",
    "* automated information extractors\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we'll apply this process to tackle a common problem facing ecommerce websites: helping consumers answer specific queries to evaluate a product. We'll see that customer reviews can be used as a rich and challenging source of information for QA, and along the way we'll learn how transformers act as a powerful *reading comprehension* models that can extract meaning from text. \n",

    "**Note:** This chapter focuses on <span style=\"color:blue\"><b>extractive QA</b></span>, but other forms of QA may be more suitable for your use case. For example, <span style=\"color:blue\">community QA</span> involves gathering question-answer pairs that are generated by users on forums like Stack Overflow, and then using semantic similarity search to find the closest matching answer to a new question. There is also <span style=\"color:blue\">long-form QA</span>, which aims to generate complex paragraph-length answers to open-ended questions like \"Why is the sky blue?\" Remarkably, it is also possible to do QA over tables, and transformer models like TAPAS can even perform aggregations to produce the final answer!\n",

    "## 7.1 - Building a review-based QA system\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever purchased a product online, you probably relied on customer reviews to help inform your decision. These reviews can often help answer specific questions like \"Does this guitar come with a strap?\" or \"Can I use this camera at night?\" that may be hard to answer from the product description alone. However, popular products can have hundreds to thousands of reviews, so it can be a major drag to find one that is relevant. One alternative is to post your question on the community QA platform provided by websites like Amazon, but it usually takes days to get an answer (if you get one at all). Wouldn't it be nice if we could get an immediate answer like Google sometimes provides with its search engine?\n",

    "### 7.1.1 - The dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our QA system we'll use the [SubjQA dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14283), which consists of more than 10000 customer reviews in English about products and services in six domains: Trip-Advisor, Restaurants, Movies, Books, Electronics, and Grocery. As illustrated in the following figure, each review is associated with a question that can be answered using one or more sentences from the review.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images_ch7/qa_product_example.PNG\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" data-align=\"center\">\n",
    "\n",
    "the interesting aspect of this dataset is that most of the questions ansd answers are *subjective*; that is, they depend on the personal experience of the users. This example shows why this feature makes the task potentially more difficult than finding answers to factual questions like \"What is the currency of the United Kingdom?\" First, the query is about \"poor quality\", which is subjective and depends on the user's definition of quality. Second, important parts of the query do not appear in the review at all, which means it cannot be answered with shortcuts like keyword search or paraphrasing the input question. These features make SubjQA a realistic dataset to benchmark our review-based QA models on, since user-generated content like that resembles what we might encounter in the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** QA systems are usually categorized by the domain of data that they have access to when responding to a query. *Closed-domain QA* deals with questions about a narrow topic (e.g., a single product category), while *open-domain QA* deals with questions about almost anything (e.g., Amazon's whole product catalog). In general, closed-domain QA involves searching through fewer documents than the open-domain case.\n",

    "**Note:** The (question, review, [answer sentences]) format of SubjQA is commonly used in extractive QA datasets, and was pioneered in the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD), which was presented in [Rajpurkar et al (2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05250). This is a famous dataset that is often used to test the ability of machines to read a passage of text and answer questions about it. The dataset was created by sampling several hundred English articles from Wikipedia, partitioning each article into paragraphs, and then asking crowdworkers to generate a set of questions and answers for each paragraph. In the first version of SQuAD, each answer to a question was guaranteed to exist in the corresponding passage. Bt it wasn't long before sequence models started performing better than humans at extracting the correct span of text with the answer. To make the task more difficult, SQuAD 2.0 was created by agumenting SQuAD 1.1 with a set of adversarial questions that are relevant to a given passage but cannot be answered from the text alone ([Rajpurkar and Liang, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03822)). The state of the art as of mid 2021 is shown in the following figure, with most models since 2019 surpassing human performance\n",

    "However, this superhuman performance does not appear to reflect genuine reading comprehension, since answers to the \"unanswerable\" questions can usually be identified through patterns in the passages like antonyms. To adress these problems Google released the Natural Questions dataset ([Kwiatkowski, 2019](dx.doi.org/10.1162/tacl_a_00276)), which involves fact-seeking questions obtained from Google search users. The answers in NQ are much longer than in SQuAD and present a more challenging benchmark.\n",

The standard way to deal with this is to apply a *sliding window* across the inputs, where each window contains a passage of tokens that fit in the model's context.

    "In our simple answer extraction example, we provided both the question and the context to the model. However, in reality our system's users will only provide a question about a product, so we need some way of selecting relevant passages from among all the reviews in our corpus. One way to do this would be to concatenate all the reviews of a given product together and feed them to the model as a single, long context. Although simple, the drawback of this approach is that the context can become extremely long and thereby introduce an unacceptable latency for our users' queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's suppose that on average, each product has 30 reviews and each review takes 100 milliseconds to process. If we need to process all the reviews to get an answer, this would result in an average latency of 3 seconds per user query - much too long for ecommerce websites!\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this, modern QA systems are typically based on the **retriever-reader** architecture, which has two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retriever**. Responsible for retrieving relevant documents for a given query. Retrievers are usually categorized as sparse or dense. Sparse retrievers use word frequencies to represent each document and query as a sparse vector. The relevance of a query and a document is then determined by computing an inner product of the vectors. On the other hand, dense retrievers use encoders like transformers to represent the query and document as contextualized embeddings (which are dense vectors). These embeddings encode semantic meaning, and allow dense retrievers to improve search accuracy by understanding the content of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reader**. Responsible for extracting an answer from the documents provided by the retriever. The reader is usually a reading comprehension model, although at the end of the chapter we'll see examples of models that can generate free-form answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images_ch7/retriever_reader_architecture.PNG\" title=\"\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" data-align=\"center\">\n",

    "To build our QA system, we'll use the [Haystack library](https://haystack.deepset.ai/) developed by deepset, a german company focused on NLP.

In particular, the retriever sets an upper bound on the performance of the whole QA system, so it's important to make sure it's doing a good job. With this in mind, let's start by introducing some common metrics to evaluate the retriever so that we can compare the performance of sparse and dense representations."

    "### 7.2.1 - Evaluating the retriever\n",
    "\n",
    "A common metric for evaluating retrievers is **recall**, which measures the fraction of all relevant documents that are retrieved. In this context, relevant simply means whether the answer is present in a passage of text or not, so given a set of questions, we can compute recall by counting the number of times an answer appears in the top $k$ documents returned by the retriever.\n",

    "In Haystack, there are two ways to evaluate retrievers:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the retriever's in-built `eval()` method. This can be used for both open- and closed-domenain QA, but for datasets like SubjQA where each document is paired with a single product and we need to filter by product ID for every query.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build a custom `Pipeline` that combines a retriever with the `EvalRetriever` class. This enables the implementation of custom metrics and query flows.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Note:** A complementary metric to recall is mean *average precision* (mAP), which rewards retrievers that can place the correct answers higher up in the document ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we need to evaluate the recall per product and then aggregate across all products, we'll opt for the second approach. Each node in the Pipeline graph represents a class that takes some inputs and produces some outputs via a run method:\n",

    "\n",
    "In our case, we need a node to evaluate the retriever, so we'll use the `EvalRetriever` class whose `run()` method keeps track of which documents have answers that match the ground truth.
