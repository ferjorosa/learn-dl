    "\n",
    "The main idea behind self-attention is that instead of using a **fixed** embedding for each token, we can use the whole sequence to compute a **weighted average** of each embedding. Another way to formulate this is to say that given a sequence of  token embeddings $\\mathbf{x} = {x_{i},\\dots, x_{n}}$ , self-attention produces a sequence of new embeddings $\\mathbf{x}' ={x_{i}',\\dots, x_{n}'}$ where each ${x_{j}'}$ is a linear combination of all the ${x_{j}'}$:\n",

We can create a representation for \"flies\" that incorporates this context by combining all the token embeddings in different proportions. For example, by assigning a larger weight $w_{ji}$ to the token embeddings of \"time\" and \"arrow\". Embeddings that are generated in this way are called **contextualized embeddings** and predate the invention of transformers in language models like ELMo ([Peters et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365)). \n",

    "There are several ways to implement a self-attention block, but the most common one is scaled dot-product attention, from the original Transformer article ([Vaswani et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)). There are four main steps required to implement this mechanism:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Compute attention scores**. We determine how much the *query* and *key* vectors relate to each other using a *similarity function*. As the name suggests, the similarity function for scaled-dot product attention is the dot product, efficiently computed using matrix multiplication. Similar queries and keys will have a large dot product, while those that don't share much n common will have little to no overlap. The outputs from this step are called the attention scores. For a sequence with *n* input tokens, there is a corresponding $n \\times n$ matrix of attention scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Compute attention weights**. Dot products can in general produce arbitrarily large numbers, which can destabilize the training process. To handle this, the attention scores are first multiplied by a scaling factor to normalize their variance and then apply the softmax function to ensure all the column values sum to 1. The resulting $n \\times n$ matrix corresponds to the attention weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the token embeddings**. Once the attention weights are computed, we multiply them by the value vector $v_{1}, \\dots, v_{n}$ to obtain an updated representation for embedding $x_{i}' = \\sum_{j} w_{ji}$.\n",

Subsequently, the pretraining objective and the architecture of BERT have been adapted to further improve performance. As of 2022, encoder-only models still dominate research and industry on NLU tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering. Let's take a brief look at the BERT model and its variants:\n",

By using a technique known as knowledge distillation during pretraining, DistilBERT achieves 97% of BERT's performance while using 40% less memoery and being 60% faster.\n",

    "A study following the release of BERT revealed that its performance can be further improved by modifying the pretraining scheme. RoBERTa is trained longer, on larger batches with more training data, and it drops the NSP task. Together these changes significantly improve its performance compared to the original BERT model.\n",

In addition, the authors introduced translation language modeling (TLM), which is an extension of MLM to multiple language inputs. Experimenting with these pretraining tasks, they achieve state-of-the-art results on several multilingual NLU benchmarks as well as on translation tasks.\n",

Using the Common Crawl corpus, its developers created a dataset with 2.5 terabytes of text; they then trained an encoder with MLM on this dataset. Since the dataset only contains data without parallel texts (i.e., translations), the TLM objective of XLM was dropped. This approach beats XLM and multilingual BERT variants by a large margin, espcially on low-resource languages.\n",

    "**ALBERT** ([Lan et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11942))\n",

    "The ALBERT model introduced three changes to make the encoder architecture more efficient. First, it decouples the token embedding dimension from the hidden dimension, thus allowing the embedding dimension to be small and threby saving parameters, especially when the covabulary gets large. Second, all layers share the same parameters, which decreases the number of effective parameters even further. Finally, the NSP objective is replaced with a sentence-ordering prediction: the model needs to predict whether or not the order of two consecutive sentences was swapped rather than predicting if they belong together at all. These changes make it possible to train even larger models with fewer parameters and reach superior performance on NLU tasks.\n",

    "One limitation of the standard MLM pretraining objective is that at each training step only the representaitons of the masked tokens are updated, while the other input tokens are not. To address this issue, ELECTRA uses a two-model approach: the first model (which is tipically small) works like a standard masked language model and predicts masked tokens. The second model, called the *discriminator*, is then tasked to predict which of the tokens in the first model's ouput were originally masked. Therefore the discriminator needs to make binary classification for every token, which results in general training efficiency. For downstream tasks, the discriminator is fine-tuned like a standard BERT model.\n",

    "The DeBERTa model introduces two architectural changes. First, each token is represented as two vectors: one for the content, the other for relative position. By disentangling the tokens' content from their relative positions, the self-attention layers can better model the dependency of nearby toekn pairs. On the other hand, the absolute position of a word is also important, especially for decoding. For this reason, an absolute position embedding is added just before the softmax layer of the token decoding head. DeBERTa is the first model (as an ensemble) to beat the human baseline on the [SuperGLUE benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00537) a more difficult version of GLUE consisting of several subtasks used to measure NLU performance."
