    "# MULTILINGUAL ENTITY RECOGNITION\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an NLP task that aims to identify and classify named entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, locations, and other predefined categories. NER systems analyze text and assign labels to specific spans, enabling information extraction and understanding of relationships between entities in various applications like information retrieval, question answering, and text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what do you do when we need to work with documents that are written in Greek, Swahili, or Klingon? One approach is to search the Hugging Face Hub for a suitable pretrained language model and fine-tune it on the task at hand. However, these pretrained models tend to exist only for \"high-resource\" languages like German, Russian, or Mandarin, where plenty of webtext is available for pretraining. Another common challenge arises when your corpus is multilingual: maintaining multiple monolingual models in production will not be any fun for you or your engineering team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there is a class of multilingual transformers that come to the resue. Like **BERT**, these models use masked language moeling as a pretraining objective, but they are trained jointly on texts in over one hundred languages. By pretraining on huge corpora across many languages, these multilingual transformers enable **zero-shot cross-lingual transfer**.This means that a model that is fine-tuned on one language can be applied to others without any further training! This also makes these models well suited for \"code-switching\", where a speaker  alternates between two or more languages or dialects in the context of a single conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we want to perform NER for a customer based in Switzerland, where there are four national languages (with English often serving as a bridge between them). We will focus on the encoder-only model **XLM-RoBERTa** ([Conneau et al., 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116)), which can be fine-tuned to perform NER across several languages."

In some cases, this ability to perform cross-lingual transfer can produce results that are competitive with those of monolingual models, which circumvents the need to train one model per language!\n",

This benchmark consists of news articles annotated with the same `LOC`, `PER` and `ORG` categories as PAN-X, but it contains an additional `MISC` label for miscellaneous entities that do not belong to the previous three groups. \n",

    "* `all`. Fine-tune on all the training data to evaluate on each language's test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will adopt similar evaluation strategy for our NER task, but first we need to select a model to evaluate. One of the first multilingual transformers was **mBERT**, which uses the same architecture and pretraining objective as **BERT** but adds Wikipedia articles from many languages to the pretraining corpus. Since then, **mBERT** has been superseded by **XLM-RoBERTa**, or **XLM-R** for short, so that is the model we'll consider in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "XLM-R uses only masked language modeling as its pretraining objective for 100 languages, but it is distinguished by the huge size of its pretraining corpus compared to its predecessors: Wikipedia dumps for each language and 2.5 terabytes of Common Crawl data from the web. This corpus is several orders of magnitude larger than the ones used in earlier models and provides a significant boost in signal for low-resource languages like Burmese and Swahili, where only a small number of Wikipedia articles exist.\n",

    "The RoBERTa part of the model's name refers to the fact that the pretrainig approach is the same as for the monolingual RoBERTa models. RoBERTa's developers improved on several aspects of BERT, in particular by removing the next sentence prediction task altogether. XLM-R also drops the language embeddings used in XLM and **uses SentencePiece** ([Kudo and Richardson, 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06226)) **to tokenize the raw texts directly**. <span style=\"color:blue\">Besides its multilingual nature, a notable difference between XLM-R and RoBERTa is the size of the respective vocabularies: 250,000 tokens versus 55,000!</span>"

We can later easily propagate the predicted label of the first subword to the subsequent subwords in the postprocessing step.

    "In this example, and contrary to the previous BERT tokenization of section 4.1, we can see that the tokenizer has split “Einwohnern” into two subwords, `▁Einwohner` and `n`. Since we’re following the convention that only `▁Einwohner` should be associated with the `B-LOC` label, we need a way to mask the subword representations after the first subword. Fortunately, `tokenized_input` is a class that contains a `word_ids()` function that can help us achieve this:"

    "From these results we can draw a few general conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multilingual learning can provide significant gains in performance, especially if the low-resource languages for cross-lingual transfer belong to similar language families. In our experiments we can see that German, French, and Italian achieve similar performance in the `all` category, suggesting that these languages are more similar to each other than to English.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a general strategy, it is a good idea to focus attention on cross-lingual transfer within language families, especially when dealing with different scripts like Japanese.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we saw how to tackle an NLP task on a multilingual corpus using a single transformer pretrained on 100 languages: **XLM-R**. Although we were able to show that cross-lingual transfer from German to French is competitive when only a small number of labeled examples are available for fine-tuning, this good performance generally does not occur if the target language is significantly different from the one the base model was fine-tuned on or was not one of the 100 languages used during pretraining. Recent proposals like **MAD-X** ([Pfeiffer et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00052)) are designed precisely for these low-resource scenarios."
