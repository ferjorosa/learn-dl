    "It's important to make efficient use of both server-side and on-device compute resources when developing machine learning. To support more efficient deployment on servers and edge devices, we can use Quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantization leverages 8bit integer (int8) instructions to **reduce the model size and run the inference faster** (reduced latency) and can be the difference when fitting a model into the available resources. In addition, even when resources aren't quite so constrained, it may enable you to deploy a larger and more accurate model.\n",

    "Therefore, by doing both computations and memory accesses with lower precision data (usually int8 compared to floating point implementations), it enables performance gains in several important areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4x reduction in model size;\n",
    "* 2-4x reduction in memory bandwith;\n",
    "* 2-4x faster inference due to savings in memory bandwith and faster compute with int8 arithmetic (the exact speed up vaires depending on the hardware, the runtime, and the model)\n",
