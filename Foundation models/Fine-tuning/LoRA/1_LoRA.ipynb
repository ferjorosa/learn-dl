    "Many previous works have shown that over-parametrized large models reside on a low intrinsic dimension. The main idea behind LoRA is that the change in weights during model adaptation also has a low intrinsic rank/dimension. Concretely, if $W_{nk}$ represents the weights of a single layer and $\\Delta W_{nk}$ represents the change of weights during model adaptation, the authors propose that $\\Delta W_{nk}$ is a low-rank matrix:\n",

    "#### Why does this make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "Large models are trained to capture the general representation of their domain (language for LLMs, audio + language for models like Whisper, and vision for image generation models). These models capture a variety of features which allow them to be used for diverse tasks with reasonable zero-shot accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, **when adapting such a model to a specific task or dataset, only a few \"features\" need to be emphasized or re-learnt**. This means that **the updated matrix ($\\Delta W_{n \\times k}$) can be a low-rank matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "LoRA arises from the idea that large models are overparametrized, so the set of parameters for any layer can be expresed by a combination of a lower rank parameter space. Take for example an attention matrix, in particular the weight matrix for the query $W_{q}$ of dimensions $e \\times h$ (embedding dimension times hidden dimension).\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of fine-tuning the $W_{q}$ matrix itself, LoRA proposes to freeze that matrix and fine tune two new matrices of dimensions $e \\times r$ and $r \\times h$, with $r$ being a low rank value (i.e. 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, when doing inference, the calculations times are the same because you will only have in memory the addition of two matrices, which will be the same as fine-tuning!\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting point is savings in memory. You can have your big model with $W_{q}$ and then have one $W_{q}^{t}$ for each one of your tasks, so each task is represented by a separate, addable, lightweight matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have to compute way less gradients. For an $e = 100$, $h=100$, $r=2$ matrix with $e \\times h = 10000$ original parameters you would be tuning just $er + rh = 200$ parameters."
