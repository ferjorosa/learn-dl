    "In recent years, large language models have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, showcasing remarkable advancements in generating human-like text, answering questions, and even engaging in intelligent conversations. These models, such as GPT, PaLM, LLaMA, etc. have astounded researchers and practitioners alike with their ability to comprehend and produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses. However, despite their unprecedented capabilities, these state-of-the-art models still possess limitations that hinder their full potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of access to current information.** Certain data constantly change. For instance, the\n",
    "exchange rate between the dollar and the Moroccan Dirham, current COVID numbers, the stock price of AAPL, the weather in Vancouver or even the current date. It is impossible, by their design, for pretrained language models to keep up with this dynamic information\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Lack of access to proprietary information sources.** As an important special case of 1, the models don’t have access to proprietary information, such as the client roster in a company’s database or the state of an online game.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Lack of probabilistic reasoning.** Probabilistic reasoning is beyond the reach of the neural approach (or it would require even more massive models that we cannot easily train/work with) and requires a dedicated reasoning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lack of arithmetic reasoning.** With GPT-4, we can see a serious improvement, but it still lacks precision, especially when dealing with float numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Model explosion.** As the demand for larger models grows, it is crucial to balance their capabilities with the cost and environmental impact. In this context, exploring alternative model architectures and training algorithms can promote energy efficiency without compromising performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential solution to mitigate these limiatations is to enhance the utility of the language model with complementary tools. These tools can provide new functionalities and assist in bias detection and mitigation, content filtering, controlled generation, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the best of my knowledge, this idea was first introducedd by [Karpas et al. (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00445.pdf), which defined a flexible architecture called *MRKL* (i.e., *Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language*). A MRKL system consists of an extendable set of modules and a \"router\" (i.e., an LLM) that routes every incoming natural language input to a module that can best respond to the input. \n",

    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea has been recently extended by [Shen et al. (2023)](), where models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace, instead of using a pre-defined one. In this paper, an LLM acts as the \"controller\". The LLM first plans a list of tasks based on the user request and then assigns expert models to each task. After the experts execute the tasks, the LLM collects the results and responds to the user.\n",

    "Some applications will require not just a predetermined chain of calls to LLMs/other tools, but potentially an unknown chain that depends on the user’s input. In these types of chains, there is a “agent” which has access to a suite of tools. Depending on the user input, the agent can then decide which, if any, of these tools to call. The utility of [**LangChain**](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html#) becomes apparent in this context, as it provides a versatile programming framework for constructing such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the moment, there are two main types of agents in LangChain:\n",
    "* [**Action Agents**](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/agents.html#action-agents): these agents decide an action to take and take that action one step at a time\n",

However, that comes at the expense of generally more calls and higher latency.

      "Action: Search[Archimedes]\u001b[0m\n",
      "Observation: \u001b[36;1m\u001b[1;3mArchimedes of Syracuse (; c. 287 – c. 212 BC) was a Greek mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and inventor from the ancient city of Syracuse in Sicily. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading scientists in classical antiquity. Considered the greatest mathematician of ancient history, and one of the greatest of all time, Archimedes anticipated modern calculus and analysis by applying the concept of the infinitely small and the method of exhaustion to derive and rigorously prove a range of geometrical theorems. These include the area of a circle, the surface area and volume of a sphere, the area of an ellipse, the area under a parabola, the volume of a segment of a paraboloid of revolution, the volume of a segment of a hyperboloid of revolution, and the area of a spiral.Archimedes' other mathematical achievements include deriving an approximation of pi, defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, and devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers. He was also one of the first to apply mathematics to physical phenomena, working on statics and hydrostatics. Archimedes' achievements in this area include a proof of the law of the lever, the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy or Archimedes' principle. He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion.\n",
      "Archimedes died during the siege of Syracuse, when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed. Cicero describes visiting Archimedes' tomb, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder that Archimedes requested be placed there to represent his mathematical discoveries.\n",
      "Unlike his inventions, Archimedes' mathematical writings were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from Alexandria read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until c. 530 AD by Isidore of Miletus in Byzantine Constantinople, while commentaries on the works of Archimedes by Eutocius in the 6th century opened them to wider readership for the first time. The relatively few copies of Archimedes' written work that survived through the Middle Ages were an influential source of ideas for scientists during the Renaissance and again in the 17th century, while the discovery in 1906 of previously lost works by Archimedes in the Archimedes Palimpsest has provided new insights into how he obtained mathematical results.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Thought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3m According to the paragraph, Archimedes' achievements include deriving an approximation of pi, defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers, proof of the law of the lever, the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, and the enunciation of the law of buoyancy or Archimedes' principle. He is also credited with designing innovative machines, such as his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines to protect his native Syracuse from invasion. So the answer is deriving an approximation of pi, defining and investigating the Archimedean spiral, devising a system using exponentiation for expressing very large numbers, proof of the law of the lever, the widespread use of the concept of center of gravity, the enunciation of the law of buoyancy or Archimedes' principle, his screw pump, compound pulleys, and defensive war machines.\n",
