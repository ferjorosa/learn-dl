    "Remember that in TD learning, we update our policy or value function (depending on the RL method we choose) **after one step of the interaction**. To produce our TD target, **we use the immediate reward $R_{t+1}$ plus the discounted value of the next best state-action pair** (we call that bootstrap). Thefore, our $Q(S_{t}, A_{t})$ update formula goes like this:\n",
